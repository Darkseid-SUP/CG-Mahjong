				<h2>Tiles</h2>

				<p>Each tile is represented by 2 characters, the first being the representation of the tile category, while the second being the value. As mentioned in the tutorial above, there are 4 tiles of each category-value combination.</p>

				<br />

				<p>List of tile categories, and their character representation:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><const>D</const>ot - <const>1</const>~<const>9</const></li>
					<li><const>B</const>amboo - <const>1</const>~<const>9</const></li>
					<li><const>C</const>haracter - <const>1</const>~<const>9</const></li>
					<li><const>W</const>ind - <const>1</const>~<const>4</const></li>
					<li>d<const>R</const>agon - <const>1</const>~<const>3</const></li>
					<li><const>F</const>lower - <const>1</const>~<const>4</const></li>
					<li><const>S</const>eason - <const>1</const>~<const>4</const></li>
				</ul>

				<p>For the suited tiles (Dot, Bamboo, Character), the value will be the numeral value. For example, "5 Dot" is represented as <const>d5</const>, while "1 Bamboo" is represented as <const>b1.</const></p>

				<br>

				<p>For the other tile categories, i.e. honour, the value represents the index of the tile type (starting from <const>1</const>), the types are ordered as follow:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Wind tile: East, South, West, North</li>
					<li>Dragon tile: Red dragon, Green dragon, White dragon</li>
					<li>Flower tile: Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo</li>
					<li>Season tile: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For example, South will be represented as <const>w2</const>, and White dragon will be represented as <const>r3</const>.</p>

				<br>

				<h2>Rounds</h2>

				<p>
				Each round, you will receive a list of actions taken by other players since your last turn, with the actions you committed being given first. You can only get non-draw actions by other players, as you aren't supposed to know what they drew.
				</p>

				<br>

				<p>There are 2 types of <var>roundType</var>, <const>normal</const> and <const>interrupt</const>.

				<br>

				Every player (including the dealer) receives 13 tiles at the beginning. Gameplay starts with a normal round, the first player (player with <var>windSeat</var>=<const>0</const>) may perform any action allowed in the normal round. After that, the next player will do the same thing. This continues until someone discards a card that <u>at least one player</u> can form a meld with it. The interrupt round then starts, every player that have the opportunity to perform an interrupting action receives input (while those who can't will not receive anything). 

				The game returns to a normal round for the player subsequent to the interrupting player if there is one, or the player subsequent to the discarding player if there is none. Gameplay continues until one player wins by completing the hand.
				</p>

				<br>

				<p>In normal round, the last actions of the list will be about the tile you drew, including the flower actions which are done automatically by the referee. In normal mode, you can perform a <action>DISCARD</action> action, or a <action>GONG</action> action if you are able to perform a <i>Concealed gong</i> or <i>Exposed kong from exposed pong.</i>

				<br>

				P.S. You can now only perform both of this gong the moment you drew the tile you want to gong with. The option to perform these gong after the draw is still not implemented yet.

				</p>

				<br>

				<p>In interrupt round, the last action of the list will be a discard. It means that you have an oppurtunity to interrupt the normal move sequence, with actions like <action>WIN</action>, <action>GONG</action>, <action>PONG</action> and <action>SEUNG</action>.

				<br>

				For <action>PONG</action> and <action>SEUNG</action>, everything will be handle in the same turn, but for <action>GONG</action>, the <action>DRAW</action> action will be given to the player as a <const>normal</const> round in the next round.

				</p>

				<br>

				<p>Since this is WIP, you still can't do a win action.</p>

				<br>

				<p>If you don't want to perform any action, you can output <action>PASS</action> (only available in interrupt round). Even if you output your action, you won't always be able to successfully perform it, as other player might have a higher priority than you. To know if you you have succeeded in performing it, you can refer to actions of the next normal round (as stated earlier, the list of actions start with the actions you performed last round, so if you don't receive that, it means that you didn't successfully commited it).</p>
